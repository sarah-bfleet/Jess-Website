           <h2>A CAREER PIVOT – Who, What, When, How?</h2>
            <img class="article-img" src="../img/jessicacomputer.jpg" alt="">
         </div>
           
        <div class="article-text">
          <p>Here’s the good news.  At this moment in January 2022 after an insane 2+ years, people are feeling more confident in their careers than they have felt in a long time. And, they are also feeling more open to exploring career change.  So, I think this would be a great time to do a deep dive into career pivots.  Let’s talk about what are career pivots, my experience with career pivots, the different kinds of pivots, and finally some Top Tips for action and impact.  
</p>
<p>Often, when we think about careers – we can’t help but frame them in a way that is all about climbing the ladder.  This idea of a career as a ladder is an idea that has been around for about 100 years. It’s our default thinking. But, the truth is we really need to let go of the ladder and the ladder-like thinking about our careers.  Quite honestly this idea of what is the next step or what is the next rung on the ladder – this imagery is no longer viable today.  It doesn’t fit our experiences or our career aspirations.  Maybe you work in marketing, but now you have decided you want to pursue sales or finance or sustainability?  Maybe you have a calling for non-profit work? Maybe you want to work 4 days a week instead of 5?  Maybe you want to start your own business and leave your organization altogether? 
</p>
<p> If I were to ask you to describe how your career feels so far – very rarely does it feel linear or certain or predictable. Or that you are doing the same job that someone before you has done.  In 2022, our careers are full of change and uncertainty. They are full of potential and possibility.  Today, we need to acknowledge that your career is as individual as you are. What’s really interesting is that research shows that we are going to have 4 or 5 types of careers during our working life. In fact, some of the most successful individuals have changed careers multiple times – people like Jeff Bezos, Ronald Reagan, Ray Kroc (founder of McDonald’s), among so many others .    The point is careers are no longer one size fits all. We all develop in different directions.  The more useful lens to use, when thinking about your career development, is to think of your career as a winding path and how you can best navigate your unique path with confidence and with control. 
</p>
<p>My own career path has been windy, and twisty, unconventional and non-traditional. I have been an entrepreneur and then I sold that business.  Then I went back to school and got an MBA. Then, I became a management consultant for a number of years, and then I created another business which I also sold.  I have been an entrepreneur, consultant, facilitator, writer and speaker.  One might say, I am a professional career pivot-er.  To many people, my career path would make their head explode but for me – this twisty and bendy path suits my strengths and my skills – I am someone who loves to start something from scratch, I love to be continually challenged and I love to do my own thing, my own way. 
</p>
<p>Now, your career pivot might look nothing like mine, you might be just beginning to consider a pivot.  You may be at the very beginning of the process or you might have been thinking about this for some time and now you feel stuck and you need some inspiration to get started.  Wherever you are in the process I am going to give you lots of ideas for action.
</p>
<p>First, let’s understand the different kinds of career pivots and which will be best for you. Sometimes when we think about pivots and what they mean, we immediately jump to the idea of a radical career redo.  You think, I am pivoting therefore I am changing everything overnight. Actually the research shows that the most successful pivots are incremental.  And the most successful pivots are those that are not about dramatic change –but are instead a small tweak. These small tweaks are more about stretching your existing strengths instead of transforming into something completely new.  So what I want to talk about are 3 different pivot possibilities that you might want to consider.  And as I explain each one, you can think about what feels right for you right now.
</p>
<ol class="article-list article-4-list">
 <li><span class="bold">90 degree Pivot</span>-This one is more of a tweak, than it is a transformation. Think of this as a small change in your existing role. This is about stretching your strengths in a different way.  This pivot involves you thinking about where else you can be useful and helpful for your team. This might mean stretching within your current role which could lead to new responsibilities. This might mean honing in on your strengths and skills and helping another team with one of your particular talents.  Think about a skill, strength or talent from a previous role that you aren’t currently using.  Another stretch might be to bring in an outside interest to your existing organization.  Are you interested in something outside of work, maybe it’s your side hustle, maybe it’s an area of expertise and think about running a workshop/talk/mini learning session in your current organization.  This can also be a great low risk, first step on an entrepreneurial journey.
</li>
 <li><span class="bold">180 degree Pivot</span>– This one is a more of a wiggle than a huge shift.  This is a change that allows you to stay in your current organization.  Not all pivots require you to leave your current company.  Sometimes a sideways or lateral move in the organization is a great way to pivot.  This would be when you move from finance to sustainability.  In order to do this well, think about how you can add value in your new role. Your previous experience will give you a unique set of skills, coupled with your existing knowledge of the company, will often allow you to generate new ideas and possibilities.  You will be able to connect new dots in new ways.  You will bring your unique networks with you.  What makes this particularly effective and makes you particularly unique - you can use all of your knowledge from one part of the business and use that in another part of the organization.

</li>
 <li><span class="bold">360 degree Pivot</span>–This is the big one – it’s a pivot to something completely new.  Starting from scratch.  This one feels very exciting and inspiring.  It’s a whole new career.  This pivot requires a good support system and a good amount of preparation.  This one is the most scary but potentially the most rewarding.  I can speak from experience, I have done this one – a few times – and I can confirm, yes it is quite scary and anxiety inducing, but if it works out – it will rejuvenate your entire mindset about your career.
 </li>
</ol>

<p class="ideas">Ideas for action</p>
<p>Ok, this is what we all came for.  What can I do? What kinds of actions can I take that will actually move me forward in this process?
</p>

<ol class="article-list">
 <li>Scan and Explore – – This is a great place to start. This is the cure to feeling stuck. This is the very beginning where you are open and learning and trying to figure out what direction you want to move.  But, how do you explore possibilities? How do you even begin to get curious about opportunities? How do you investigate brand new directions? This is the time to remove any and all constraints. At this moment, there are no barriers – everything is on the table. This feels great in principle but not so easy to put into action.  How do you bring this to life? The first thing you need to do is think about what are your career criteria? What are your must have’s? What are your nice to have’s? What are your anchors? But you are probably asking yourself - how do I even figure out my career criteria?
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
     <li>Go to LinkedIn (or monster.com, or indeed.com, or any job board whatsoever) – Just look at job opportunities. Pick 5-10 different roles that you are attracted to. Pick jobs where there is something that you find intriguing, something that draws you to those jobs.  Remember you are not applying to those roles which is liberating because you can ignore all of the stuff you don’t like.  You are just using this for insight and for data.  In fact, it is best to think as far and wide as you can.  Do not restrict to your industry.  Underline or circle the things that drew you to those roles.  Collect first and then see what they all have in common.  Maybe the themes are collaboration, innovation, design.  Wherever the common threads exist – those will be your career criteria. You will probably have 2-3 must-haves – not more than that.  Must have’s will give you energy and excitement.   Your remaining criteria will be your nice to have’s.  But use your must have’s as a magnet and allow yourself to be drawn in those directions. 
</li>
<li>What is the purpose of doing this? – By scanning and exploring you will begin to understand your career must haves.  It also opens up possibilities and opportunities. It will open your thinking to things that you hadn’t considered before.  And it will start to give you confidence that you can transfer your skills in ways that you hadn’t imagined before. 
</li>
    </ol>
 </li>
<li>Networks and Working your Weak ties –What are your weak ties? These are your acquaintances, past colleagues, past schoolmates.  These are not your closest friends or colleagues.   Your weak ties become really important in a career pivot because your weak ties are people who know things that you don’t know, and know people that you don’t know.
 <ol class="lower-alpha">
  <li>Re-connect –There is no need to feel embarrassed or apologetic.  People enjoy helping each other.  In fact there is scientific research to back this up – it is called a helper’s high.  It’s the wonderful feeling we get when we help someone else.  So, just go for it.
</li>
<li>Use your strong ties to get new connections for your weak ties.   This is great tip for people who might not be such natural “network-ers.” Ask your closest friends and colleagues who they might know that could be helpful.  These are your cheerleaders and your champions.  You never know who knows who.</li>
<li>Say YES  – Think about doing some different things. Say yes when you normally would say no.  Make some space to actively explore possibilities. Remember one small action this week, one small action next week, all of it will snowball and create a big difference. 
</li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li>Transfer Your Talents – How to position yourself in the right way - To position yourself effectively for a pivot you have to feel confident in your abilities. Think about your transferable talents.  Think about your strengths – what is the work that gives you energy? What is the work that I want to be known for?  What do people say about me when I am not in the room? When am I at my best at work? Remember, you decide what you want your strengths to be.
</li>
</ol>
<p> If you are thinking of an internal pivot, think about that one manager that you need to convince.  Connect the dots for them– make the case for your particular set of strengths and why that is what the organization needs.  
</p>
<p>Just to summarize – it’s a great time to pivot, there are loads of people considering it, it can be as minimal or as dramatic as you would like.  I suggest start smaller, stay open to possibilities, work your networks, stretch your strengths and connect the dots in new ways.  Good luck on this exciting new bend and twist in your career.
