           <h2>Happier at Work</h2>
            <img class="article-img" src="../img/article6pic.jpg" alt="">
         </div>
           
        <div class="article-text">
          <p>Happiness is the secret ingredient for success (Richard Branson). I believe if people are happy at work,
people will go on to achieve extraordinary things for the companies that they work for. I believe
business has the capacity to create more equitable and happier world. Happiness is a serious tool for
business. The happier your employees, the happier your customers, the more successful your business
will be. And the truth is there is a lot of evidence now that says the most successful organizations in
terms of having an engaged work force are 20% more profitable, 20% more productive, have much
lower sick days, have much lower turnover. All of the evidence says – whether it is causal or not, if you
have a happy and engaged workforce you are more successful. For me the benefits flow from an
individual being happy at work, a company getting all the benefits from that and society more generally.</p>

<p>We have all heard about the record number of employees quitting their jobs. But what we don’t realize
is that this is a moment in time. This is a moment for every organization to take this opportunity to
listen, to adapt, to change and to improve. Organizations must take the time to understand why
employees are leaving. The pandemic has taught us - we all want a more human place to work. We
want workplaces that take into account our humanity – our mental health, our physical health, and our
overall well being. Organizations that take the time to learn why—and act thoughtfully—will have an
edge in attracting and retaining talent.</p>

<p>If you care about your people and your focus is their happiness – then they stay longer, they are more
committed, they work harder, they take fewer sick days and in turn your customers will get better
service, and you will have a more sustainable business.</p>

<p>It’s about 5 core fundamentals that businesses can address to ensure that their employees actually enjoy
coming to work: reward and recognition, information (giving staff enough of it and sharing it openly),
empowerment, wellbeing, and instilling pride and job satisfaction.</p>

<p>The 5 steps to happier workplaces
</p>
<ol class="article-list">
 <li>Reward and recognition
</li>
<li>Info sharing</li>
<li>Empowerment</li>
<li>Feeling pride</li>
<li>Job satisfaction</li>
</ol>

<p>How in a very practical sense do you do that? What are the benefits? 
</p>
<p>How do you achieve it?  What is it really?  Because I think it’s tangible. I think it’s measurable I don’t think it’s a subjective concept where you just go in and give people cupcakes or a ping pong table and poof everyone is happy.  I think it is about far more measurable things that drive engagement and happiness at work.  You hear people talk about work life balance, although you get work and then you have a life.  But work has got to be more than that – and you have to help people find more in their work and if they are not finding it, you have to help them find work that they do find more enjoyable. 
</p>
<p>What are the things that drive workplace happiness and engagement.
</p>
<ol class="article-list article-4-list">
 <li>Reward and recognition – People often think this the most important. It seems to come up first and is often assumed to be the most important issue for people – but I am not sure that it really is.  People think if I am paid more – I will be happier at work and the conversation seems to start there.  But really it seems that pay only minimizes discontent (herzberger) – the truth is if you are paid 5 or 10% less than you think you are worth – everyday it will eat at you. If you are paid 5 or 10% more than you think you are worth – you do not run into work and you do not work harder.  So what is critical is people have to perceive that their pay is fair.  Once you have achieved that baseline “fairness,” pay stops driving performance and it does not add any more to your happiness at work. 

  <ol class="lower-alpha article-list">
   <li>ACTION ITEM: Managers - Try to make it easy for people to be recognized  and encourage good performance because we have become a culture of criticism. We have forgotten the power of praising.  Pay mitigates discontent. Pay has to be fair, doesn’t drive performance beyond that point where you think you are being paid fairly. Recognition has a huge impact on how you feel about work. 
</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Information Sharing – I have personally been quite interested in transparency in organizations. It seems we have all of the structures in place for transparency and info sharing (i.e. – zoom, Microsoft teams, slack,) what is holding us back now is culture. It is what we do with information.  I think we need to look at information from 2 perspectives -one is  do you have enough information to do your job well.  In other words, have you been trained appropriately to do your job?  Because if people have been given a job and they have not been taught how to do it  – they lose confidence very quickly.  The second perspective -  do you understand what is going on in your organization, do you understand your place within it, and does management openly share information. Does everybody, everywhere know how everything is going.  Some suggestions: weekly magazine, sharing board minutes.  If people feel they are being trusted with information in a culture that is open – this aids their happiness and it aids their engagement. There is nothing worse than working in a business and constantly thinking – what is the management thinking? What are they going to do? Restructure? Is my job safe? Budget? That means that you are always living with this uncertainty that the world around is going to change and you don’t know.  So if you can take that anxiety  away by giving people a better understanding of what is happening overall coupled with the very best that you can do to equip people to do their job then that kind of information sharing breeds happiness and engagement and happiness at work.  The lack of information creates a level of nervousness and anxiety.  
</li>
 <li>Empowerment – what can people practically do to create environments where people feel empowered at work?  A lot of it is about trusting the individual to take responsibility.  For example, you have an annual performance review – there are 2 extremes of how it can be done – I can either give you a list of things that I want you to do in the year ahead and then we meet a year later and I cross off what you have accomplished and not and mark you on how well you have done them and then I can give you a list for next year.  The second way I can do this is: I can say to you – how has the past year been? What have you done well? What can you do better? What more support could I have given you? What more results would you have ideally liked? And then looking at the year ahead, I can ask you the same set of questions. What are your ambitions for the year ahead? What would you like to achieve? What training would you like? What resources do you need? What support do you need from me? In one of these reviews – you become the owner of what you are doing and in the other you are a slave/captive. And so that whole notion of trying to give people responsibility even when there is a task to do collectively.  It’s at an early stage saying to people how we should do this? Because there is always more than one way to do it. What support do you need? How do we achieve these things?  That support is hugely important.  That’s the real difference. If you accept that, then of course you accept people’s mistakes.  Of course, you accept that people do things differently. It’s not about imposing your will or your thought process on someone else.  Accept that everyone has a different way of doing things.

  <ol class="lower-alpha article-list">
   <li>Buy in if somebody disagrees with you the first thing you do is you to say to them- how have you come to that point of view? What’s brought you to think that’s the best way forward? And then if you sit and you really listen – it will allow you to do one of 2 things: change your world view because you have heard something new and you have added it to your knowledge back or you will be better to explain to someone else why you see the world in a different way.  If you adopt that attitude at work – which you will have a different point of view than me and I really want to hear your point of view then I wall explain to you if I have a different point of view why it’s different.  You move forward and you have consensus. Therefore, if you just accept that everyone is different, everyone is going to try and do things in a different way then you will just ultimately get to a much better place in terms of collective agreement and consensus. It might take a little longer but so long as the house isn’t on fire, but on so many issues in business the house is genuinely not on fire and you do genuinely have the time to sit down and say look, I am thinking about doing this I haven’t made my mind up but it could be a good idea.  What do you think?  And the minute you do that you start getting involvement and you start getting other people taking responsibility for the idea and you start collectively sharing ideas. Then when you deliver the whole team can celebrate. So many times – the boss says – ok we are doing this.  Everyone goes and does their part and then at the end the boss says we should celebrate.  At that point, it’s not really the teams work, it was their idea and therefore thinking about how you can empower the team, recognize the team, pay the team, and reward the team. Manager as coach – to improve competency and productivity.  If you are going to be a manager – the first thing you need is credibility- you need experience doing the job. Get the team to work through the level that they achieve thru coaching and development. Manager- to inspire, to persuade getting people that you have no control over  - to get them to do what you want them to do and that skill can be taught.  
</li>
   
  </ol>

</li>
 <li>Instilling pride – What does that mean – when someone goes into work they feel that they are doing something worthwhile and there are 2 ways that you can create that. Everybody must understand their role in the greater goal (jfk shook hands with a cleaner – what do you do? I’m helping to put a man on the moon.  And really good companies define that.  

 </li>
 <li>Job Satisfaction – and there are 2 main areas that contribute to people being satisfied at work: personal development and the strength of your relationship with your line manager.  What do we need to do in companies so that people feel like they are developing personally and so that they have effective conversations and relationships with line managers? 85% of people say that the reason that they leave companies is because of the relationship that they don’t have with their line manager.  For me it’s about managers understanding the 6 steps and understanding what they need to do to be an engaging leader rather than an authoritarian manager.  And it’s about thinking about how they would feel if they are treated in that way.  What you often find it’s managers that are most often concerned with the relationship they have with their line manager and people are very good at looking up and saying  I wish my relationship was better with my manager and people very rarely reflect the other way.
