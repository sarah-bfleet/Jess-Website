           <h2>How to be Happy at Work</h2>
            <img class="article-img" src="../img/article-one-img.jpg" alt="">
         </div>
           
        <div class="article-text">
         <p class="article-p1">I am going to talk about happiness at work.  It is sort of implied in everything that I do – I am all about helping people to be happier at work and to be their best at work, but I wanted to cover the issue head on.  So, let’s take a quick look at some research around happiness at work, why is this even important, and why it matters. I am going to give you my definition of happiness at work.  And then we are going to get into some Top Tips – some actions that you can take that really make a difference in our happiness at work.</p>
         <p>A quick bit about what we know about happiness and happiness at work. First – some myth busting.  We have all been taught that success equals happiness.  But, the fundamental theory that I have seen in a bunch of research is actually the opposite .  Instead of success equals happiness, we need to flip the order – in fact, happiness equals success. Ok, so what does that mean? I think it’s worth pausing a moment and really understanding those 2 things.  At some point, we have all said “I will be really happy when “X” happens, or “I’ll be really happy when I get promoted to manager,” or “When I lose the last 10 pounds.” When in fact, what most research shows, that in those moments you are a little bit happier, but it’s a tiny burst of happiness.  You get a mini spike and that lasts for a really short period of time and then you actually go back to your baseline.  In other words, a lot of our happiness comes from our mindset, the way that we approach things, the way that we view the world.</p>
         <p>This idea of mindset is probably what reflects most on how people bring themselves to work.  Are they naturally trying to be positive, make things work, trying to see the best in people or is it the opposite? And actually, a lot of our success and then our own happiness at work is wrapped up in what we start off with and what that mindset is.  Perception is reality.  If you perceive something as stressful, it will feel more stressful.  If you perceive something as joyful – that is exactly how it will feel.</p>
         <p>Ok, so what does the research say? Adam Grant and Elizabeth Gilbert have some very interesting ideas on being happy at work and sometimes that does not always mean finding your passion or doing the thing you love the most.  We have all heard the saying – find your purpose, find your passion.  But is that really the path to happiness at work? Adam Grant says instead of “doing what you love,” we should pursue the things where we are going to learn the most. Often “doing what you love” results in people feeling more pressure– because what if those things don’t pay very well, or are very difficult to even get.  Elizabeth Gilbert makes a similar argument where she says there are 4 kinds of work: hobbies (fun, but doesn’t pay), jobs (not so much fun, but pays), career (ideally both fun and pays), and purpose/calling (career “nirvana”).  Effectively she says don’t beat up a job for what it isn’t.  There is a time and place for everything.  Sometimes, having a job to pay the bills can be great because you don’t have the responsibility and maybe it leaves enough hours in your day so that you can do the stuff you really love to do. And, if you are in a career that you don’t really love – maybe it’s time to just get a job.  And, you know what, not everybody has a calling or purpose – and that’s absolutely fine too.  Instead of creating this career pedestal – which ultimately makes you un-happy because we all think that we are supposed to be living our purpose or doing something incredibly meaningful, that when we aren’t, we are somehow less than – how about we let that go?  Instead, focus on where you are in your life at the present moment and do the work that best fits that time.</p>
         <p>Ok, so let’s make this personal.  What does happiness at work mean for you? For me, there are three things that define “happy at work.” First, I have to know that my work is having an impact and that I am achieving in some way.  I want my work to matter and I want to feel that my contribution is making a difference.  I want people to notice when I’m not there.  Second, I am at my happiest at work when I am working with people that I like.  I want to be with people who are high energy, and positive and people that I can trust. Third, I like to feel that I am learning and stretching myself in some way. I love to be challenged and inspired.  I want to learn new things and to be in an environment that encourages that.  Now, that sounds like a really high bar.  But I am answering the question when am I happiest at work.  When I am more realistic, I would probably be happy with just one or two of those things at a certain time.  I don’t expect all of those things all of the time.  But this is a great exercise that will bring more self awareness and will allow you to name those things that are most important to you.</p>
         <p>At the beginning of this – I promised you some Top Tips to help people take some small steps that can have some real results. So here we go:</p>
         <ol class="article-list">
          <li>
           <p>RELATIONSHIPS – The quality of our relationships are the #1 factor in determining our happiness.  And, it is the QUALITY of those relationships not the QUANTITY.  So, what meaningful relationships do you have with people at work? And how much time do you make for those relationships?</p> 
           <p>My suggestion here – this is more than a quick chat before or after a meeting.  This looks more like getting a coffee with someone or grabbing lunch.  Start out with the people that you naturally gravitate towards and work towards expanding that circle.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
           <p>VALUES – Now, what does that even mean?  Everyone has their own definition, but for me it’s your career must have’s and must not’s. Your values will become your GPS and that will guide you.  There are no wrong turns here.  They can shift and change as you shift and change.  Think of your values are as the building blocks to fundamentally understanding why and how you can be happy at work. </p> 
           <p>How do you figure that out? I want you to think back to projects, teams, organizations where you have been most happy.  What was happening at those times? That will give you some clues as to what your values are and what is most important to you. Conversely, when you have been most miserable – try to hone in on what was the source of your unhappiness.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>DEEP WORK – I like to think of this as when you are in your flow.  We all know that feeling: you are focused and concentrating.  It is when you are doing deep meaningful work without distractions.  It is the counterpoint to that question we ask ourselves on Friday – what did I even do this week?</p> 
            <p>This one takes deliberate action and attention.   You need to carve out time to do concentrated work that is meaningful to you, otherwise the small trivial stuff will swallow your day.  Think about what is one project that I can make significant progress on.  Once you have answered that question, then plan how you are going to create that time.  Maybe it’s blocking out time in your calendar with a “fake meeting,” maybe it’s doing some extra bit of work before you officially start your day – find what works for you in your life and will work within the parameters of  your organization.  Deep work makes a difference to your happiness – find something that YOU want to do and make a promise to yourself to get it done.</p></li>
            <li>SHARE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES – This one ties back to where we started – our mindset. We are all really great at complaining at the end of the day to our partner or friend. How about we start to share when we have a great day.  And that needs to be said out loud or written down.  You can’t just keep it floating in your brain (although sometimes that works for me!).  We all have a bias towards the negative and this tip tries to even the scales a bit on that one. How to do this one:  it’s important that it gets written down so gratitude journal, text a friend, or even call your mom – do what works for you, but allow yourself to revel in the good stuff when you can.  See and how it makes me feel – observe the one thing that you are grateful for.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>There’s a lot of stuff here to think about.  But if you begin by taking a moment (or two) and thinking about a job that you really liked – what was it that you really loved – the people? The work?  Your role?  Begin to create your own career must have’s and must not’s.  That awareness alone will set you down a path of creating a career (or a job for that matter) that will bring you closer to your unique definition of happiness at work. </p>
