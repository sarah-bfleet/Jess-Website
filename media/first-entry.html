           <h2>How to be Happy at Work</h2>
            <img class="article-img" src="../img/article-one-img.jpg" alt="">
         </div>
           
        <div class="article-text">
         <p class="article-p1">There was a lot of attention to the fact that 2021 was, according to
Forbes Magazine, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90646274/the-great-resignation-is-here-this-is-how-employers-should-prepare" target="_blank" class="article-source">the year of the great resignation.</a></p>
<p>Which begs the question: what makes people happy at work?</p>
<p>It’s a pretty broad query, and obviously, there is no one-size-fits-all.</p>
<p>I would argue that “dream job” and “happy at work” are two
loaded terms. Like “match made in heaven” and “having it all” they
join the ranks of expectations that set us up for disappointment.</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s take a quick look at some research around happiness at
work, why is this even important, and why it matters. I will give you
my definition of happiness at work. And then we are going to get
into some Top Tips: actions that you can take right now that will
make a difference in your happiness at work.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a quick look at some research around happiness
at work – what is the psychology behind it, and why it matters.
And to do that properly, some myth-busting is in order.</p>
<p>We have all been taught that success equals happiness. But the
research done by psychologists and scientists tells us it is actually
the opposite. We need to flip the order of that statement because,
in fact, happiness equals success.</p>
<p>While difficult to measure, happiness is usually an attribute of an
individual and it’s based more on an internal experience than

external factors like promotions and financial reward. Sonja
Lyubomirsky Ph.D. is a pioneer in the field of positive psychology.
According to <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf" target="_blank" class="article-source"> Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener</a> (2005), numerous
studies have shown that happy people tend to be successful
across multiple domains in life, including work performance,
health, income, friendship, and even marriage.</p>
<p>At some point, we have all said, “I will be really happy when “X”
happens, or “I’ll be really happy when I get promoted to manager,”
or “when I lose the last 10 pounds.” Psychologists call this kind of
thinking conditional happiness. We all know eagerly anticipating
some future event or passionately imagining some future scenario
will not result in any kind of lasting happiness. In fact, what
research shows is that in those moments when you do achieve &quot;X&quot;
you are in fact, a little bit happier, but it’s a tiny burst of happiness.
You get a mini spike of happiness and that lasts for a short period
of time and then you tend to go back to your baseline. In other
words, lasting happiness comes from our mindset. We need to
focus on the way that we approach things, the way that we view
the world.</p>
<p>Mindset is clearly is what reflects most on how people experience
work. Are they naturally trying to be positive, make things work,
trying to see the best in people or is it the opposite? Perception is
reality. If you perceive something as stressful, it will feel more

stressful. If you perceive something as joyful – that is exactly how it
will feel.</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s make this personal. What does happiness at work
mean for <span class="underline">you</span>?</p>
<p>When I think about this, I think there are three questions you need
to ask yourself to determine if you are happy at work.</p>
<p class="bolder">Am I having an impact?</p>
<p>Is your work having an impact? Are you achieving in some way? If
you’re like me, I want my work to matter, and I want to feel that
my contribution is making a difference.</p>
<p class="bolder">Am I working with the right people?</p>
<p>Are you working with quality people? Are they high-energy,
positive people whom you can trust? Do they inspire you to up
your skills and bring your a-game?</p>
<p class="bolder">Am I growing?</p>
<p>If a job is fulfilling, you will be learning and stretching yourself in
some way. I love to be challenged and inspired. I want to learn
new things and to be in an environment that encourages
innovation.</p>
<p>Now, all of these things may sound like a high bar, but I am
answering the question, “when am I <span class="italics">happiest</span> at work?” When I
am more realistic, I would probably be happy with just one or two

of those things at a certain time. I don’t expect <span class="italics">all</span> of those things
<span class="italics">all</span> of the time. So, ask yourself, when have I been happiest at
work? What was happening? Who was I working with? What kind
of work was I doing? This is a great exercise that will bring more
self-awareness and allow you to name those things that are most
important to you.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this, I promised you some Top Tips to help you
take some small steps that can have some real results in achieving
more happiness at work. So here we go. Here are 4 things for you
to focus on that will begin to bring you more happiness at work.</p>
         <ol class="article-list">
          <li>
           <p>RELATIONSHIPS – The quality of our relationships is the #1
factor in determining our happiness. Period. And it’s
important to note here that it is <span class="underline">not</span> the quantity of
relationships that matters. Evaluate what meaningful
relationships you have with people at work and how much
time you make for those relationships.</p> 
           <p>So, how can we improve the quality of our relationships at
work? My suggestion here is that this is more than a quick
chat before or after a meeting. This looks more like getting a
coffee with someone or grabbing lunch. Start out with the
people that you naturally gravitate towards and work at
expanding that circle.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
           <p>VALUES – Now, what does that even mean? Everyone has
their own definition of values, but for me, these are your
<span class="bolder">career must-haves and dealbreakers.</span>Your values will
become your GPS and they will guide you throughout your
career. They can and will shift and change as you shift and
change. Think of your values as the building blocks to
fundamentally understanding why and how you can be
happy at work.
<p>How do you figure that out? I want you to think back to
projects, teams, organizations where you have been most
happy. What was happening at those times? That will give
you some clues as to what your values are and what is most
important to you. Conversely, when you have been most
miserable – try to hone in on the source of your unhappiness.</p> 
</li>
           <li>
            <p>DEEP WORK – I like to think of this as when you are in your
flow. We all know that feeling: the times you are focused and
concentrating. It is when you are doing deep, meaningful
work without distractions. It is the counterpoint to that
question we ask ourselves on Friday – <span class="italics">what did I even do this
week?</span></p>
<p>This one takes deliberate action and attention. You need to
carve out time to do concentrated work that is meaningful to

you, otherwise, the small trivial stuff will swallow your day.
Think about what is one project that I can make significant
progress on? Once you have answered that question, then
plan how you are going to create that time. Maybe it’s
blocking out time in your calendar with a “fake meeting,”
maybe it’s doing some extra bit of work before you officially
start your day. Find what works for you in your life and will be
manageable within the parameters of your organization.
Deep work makes a difference to your happiness – find
something that YOU want to do and make a promise to
yourself to get it done.</p>
</li>
            <li>
             <p>SHARE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES – This one ties back to where
we started – our mindset. We are all really great at
complaining at the end of the day to our partner or friend. My
suggestion here is to bring a bit more deliberate thought to
the good things that happened at work. And it needs to be
said out loud or written down. You can’t just keep it floating
in your brain (although sometimes that works for me!).</p>
<p>How to do this one: it’s important that it gets written down so
note it in a gratitude journal or text a friend or a family
member – do what works for you, but allow yourself to enjoy
the good stuff when you can.</p>
             </li>
         </ol>
        <p>There’s a lot of to think about in order to personalize your
happiness at work. But if you begin by taking a moment or two
and thinking about a job that you really liked – what was it that
you really loved – the people? The work? Your role? You begin to
create your own career must-haves and dealbreakers. That
awareness alone will set you down a path of creating a career (or a
job for that matter) that will bring you closer to your unique
definition of happiness at work.</p>
